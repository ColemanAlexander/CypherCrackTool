## My thought process
So my thinking was it can be one of these possible ciphers:
Shift, Substitution, Vignere or Permutation, I doubt that its a Vernam cipher due to the lack of symbols.
Putting the ciphertext through cyberchef and testing all possible shift rotations we find no solution. With this I concluded that its
probably not a shift cipher and moved on to the next one being a sub cipher. 
Using an online frequency analyser shown in the figure below:

The most occuring letters are S, O and G, in English the most occuring letters are E, A and R. https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjD9v_m7rGBAxUy1QIHHaLWDjwQFnoECAsQAw&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rd.com%2Farticle%2Fcommon-letters-english-language%2F&usg=AOvVaw39KD6_FsrF-UZpIHrND7aP&opi=89978449 

The first word in the cipher is GFS which could be E?a, a?e, r?a, etc. Another reccuring word in the cipher is OG which could be of, to, in, it, is, be, as, at, so, we, he, by, or, on, do, if, me, my, up, an, go, no, us, am  https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjP7MzW77GBAxXS1wIHHZTHADgQFnoECAkQAw&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww3.nd.edu%2F~busiforc%2Fhandouts%2Fcryptography%2Fcryptography%2520hints.html%23%3A~%3Atext%3DThe%2520most%2520common%2520two%252Dletter%2Cwords%2520are%2520the%2520and%2520and.&usg=AOvVaw2Rzevwga2W1J1CuuAFn-KX&opi=89978449 

so o could most likely be i or a or maybe o. I also see GK, GC, GF, LG. and from the list  of popular 2 letter words the letter occuring infront and at the back alot is o.  So lets assume G is o. This means s and o are still possibly e, a or r. A popular three letter occurrance is OIS so this could be are, was, can, the, and. https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjGk7bz8bGBAxVZ1AIHHT_MDE8QFnoECAsQAw&url=https%3A%2F%2Fbyjus.com%2Fenglish%2F3-letter-words%2F%23%3A~%3Atext%3DWhat%2520are%2520the%2520most%2520common%2C%252C%2520can%252C%2520you%252C%2520etc.&usg=AOvVaw2-WSgjNcHPN2ULfWvRiEek&opi=89978449 

A line in the cipher “OG OIS CGKE GC OIS” makes me doubt that OIS is and because using and this frequently is uncommon. if im assuming g is o. then o being t would make the most sense. so in this case OIS would be THE. making OG = TO
with this logic, K, F and C can be: f, n, r and L can be: t, s, g, n
OISF is one of the words and will only make sense if F is n: OIS = the and OISF = then
LISSO can be THeet, Sheet, GHeet. sheet makes the most sense so L is S.
DSOOSK can be ?etter, ?ettef. K being r makes the most sense here and d might be b, l, w, etc. not sure but K is definitely r making C = F
OIPKU can be third or maybe thurl but most likely its third so lets assume P=i and U=d
with this MFU can be ?nd which is either end or and with s being e lets assume m is a
LMES can be sa?e. which can be same, sale, sage, sake, save.
EGLO can be most, lost, gost, kost, vost. 3 of these aren’t words, so e can be l, m
CGKE can be forl or form so e is probably m
looking at NIMFRSU, NDMLLPCY, SMNI, n is looking like its c, then those words would be chan?ed, c?assif?, each so N=C, D=L, Y=Y which is very misleading.
with this SFNKYHOSU would be encry?ted which makes h = p
NGQFO is co?nt which could make q=u. 
NKYHOGRKME is crypto?ram which makes R=G.
HDMPFOSXO is plainte?t and OSXO is te?t which makes it clear X=X.
since I have most of the letters lets look at the text solved slightly:
cipher text now:
one Way to solVe an encrypted message, if We
BnoW its language, is to find a …
so from this piece of solved text w=w, v=v and I assume b=k
I found all necessary matches (AJTZ still unknown) which confirms that this is a substitution cipher if it was a vignere cipher I wouldn’t have found any words that make sense. Once I started piecing words together I ignored the possibility of a different cipher.
below are images of me trying to solve it by hand please ignore the Japanese. since AJTZ were not found and BJQZ was left, I assigned A=B, J=J, T=Q, Z=Z.

## The code snippet that deciphers this specific encryption
imageBitmap is the image that the user captured. This code is designed to modify the text reocgnized in the image and decrypt it according to map_of_letters and then join the decyphered letters into a single string outputting it in the application. If the text recognition failed it will say "Nothing to show". It the user clicks "DECIPHER" without taking a picture the application says "Select an image first".

        private fun processImage() {
                var map_of_letters = mapOf(" " to " ", "A" to "B", "B" to "K", "C" to "F", "D" to "L", "E" to "M", "F" to "N", "G" to "O", "H" to "P", "I" to "H", "J" to "Q", "K" to "R", "L" to "S", "M" to "A", "N" to "C", "O" to "T", "P" to "I", "Q" to "U", "R" to "G", "S" to "E", "T" to "J", "U" to "D", "V" to "V", "W" to "W", "X" to "X", "Y" to "Y", "Z" to "Z")

        if (imageBitmap!=null){

            val image=imageBitmap?.let {

                InputImage.fromBitmap(it, 0)

            }

            image?.let {

                recognizer.process(it)
                    .addOnSuccessListener {



                        var textinlist = it.text.toList()


                        val modifiedList = mutableListOf<String>()

                        for (i in 0 until textinlist.size) {
                            val element = textinlist[i]
                            val modifiedElement = if (map_of_letters.containsKey(element.toString())) {
                                map_of_letters[element.toString()] ?: element
                            } else {
                                element
                            }

                            modifiedList.add(modifiedElement.toString())
                        }

                        var decipheredtext = modifiedList.joinToString().replace(",", "")





                        binding.textView.text=decipheredtext
                    }
                    .addOnFailureListener{

                        Toast.makeText(this, "Nothing to show", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
                    }

            }

        }


        else{

            Toast.makeText(this, "Please select image first", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
        }
    }


## Solution


ONE WAY TO SOLVE AN ENCRYPTED MESSAGE IF WE KNOW ITS LANGUAGE IS TO FIND A DIFFERENT PLAINTEXT OF THE SAME LANGUAGE LONG ENOUGH TO FILL ONE SHEET OR SO THEN WE COUNT THE OCCURRENCES OF EACH LETTER, WE CALL THE MOST FREJ..?



So J=Q, I missed that one... This makes T=J




ONE WAY TO SOLVE AN ENCRYPTED MESSAGE IF WE KNOW ITS LANGUAGE IS TO FIND A DIFFERENT PLAINTEXT OF THE SAME LANGUAGE LONG ENOUGH TO FILL ONE SHEET OR SO THEN WE COUNT THE OCCURRENCES OF EACH LETTER, WE CALL THE MOST FREQUENTLY OCCURRING LETTER THE 'FIRST' THE NEXT MOST OCCURRING LETTER THE 'SECOND' THE FOLLOWING MOST OCCURRING LETTER THE 'THIRD' AND SO ON UNTIL WE ACCOUNT FOR ALL THE DIFFERENT LETTERS IN THE PLAINTEXT SAMPLE, THEN WE LOOK AT THE CIPHER TEXT WE WANT TO SOLVE AND WE ALSO CLASSIFY ITS SYMBOLS. WE FIND THE MOST OCCURRING SYMBOL AND CHANGE IT TO THE FORM OF THE 'FIRST' LETTER OF THE PLAINTEXT SAMPLE THE NEXT MOST COMMON SYMBOL IS CHANGED TO THE FORM OF THE 'SECOND' LETTER AND THE FOLLOWING MOST COMMON SYMBOL IS CHANGED TO THE FORM OF THE 'THIRD' LETTER AND SO ON UNTIL WE ACCOUNT FOR ALL SYMBOLS OF THE CRYPTOGRAM WE WANT TO SOLVE..
